# VMQ_Compiler
C++ to VMQ Compiler

Author:  Thomas Ferguson

This source code is for a Flex/Yacc based compiler, written in C, that is will compile a small and basic subset of the C++ language into a virtual assembly-esque code called VMQ.

This is based entirely off of a group school project, of which I was the primary contributor.  The original version that was turned in can be found here: https://github.com/Ssuarez0/CS4300-Group-Projects.  The final version of the group project was largely unfinished and incredibly messy.

This version is entirely written by me, from the ground up.  My goal is to finish the entire project, and keep the code correct and looking presentable.  The code is being developed on and for Unix (Darwin v15.6.0).  The Makefile works based off of this constraint.
